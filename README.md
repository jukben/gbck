## Introduction

Gbck is an intuitive lightweight tool for an easy and seamless backup of your files e.g. various [config files](https://github.com/jukben/dotfiles). It's built to be an easy and flexible as possible.
All you have to do is just to create the config file containing all files (and/or commands' stdouts) you desire to back up.

```

Note: gbck stores every information under `~/.gbck`

### Create a new project

For a creation of a new project just run `gbck --init`.

You project will be saved inside `~/.gbck/<project-name>/`

* `config`
* `README.md`
* `.vsc` - the actual Git repository folder

If you use `--force` or `-f` option you will be able to rewrite already existing project.

Now it's time to configure it, so open a `~/.gbck/<project-name>/config` and go on.

> Check out this example [configuration](https://github.com/jukben/dotfiles/blob/master/.gbck/config) üí™

`config` has to be valid JSON:

* Fields `url: string`, `readme: string`, `entities: Array` are mandatory.
* Field `syncConfig: boolean` is optional and defaults to true.
* Field `branch: string` is optional and defaults to "master".

next, `entities` has to be an array:

* If the item is type of string it has to point to file or directory if so the file or directory will by backed up.

* If the item is a type of array, the first item of that array is the final file name and the second item is the command which will be run and its stdout will be backed up into this file.

* If the item is a type of object. The `i:string` and `o:string` property are mandatory, `i` is input file / folder, `o` is output name. There could be also `options: object` property defined. Possible options are:
  * `symlinks: boolean`, defaults to true
  * `exclude: Array<glob>` defaults to []
  * `include: Array<glob>` defaults to []

```json
{
  "url": "git@github.com:jukben/dotfiles.git",
  "readme": "README.md",
  "syncConfig": false,
  "entities": [
    {
      "i": "~/.config/fish",
      "o": ".config/fish",
      "options": {
        "symlinks": false,
        "exclude": ["fishd.dca90476d2cf"]
      }
    },
    {
      "i": "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json",
      "o": "vscode/settings.json"
    },
    "~/.tmux.conf",
    "~/.gitignore",
    "~/.vimrc",
    ["brew-cask.txt", "brew cask list"]
  ]
}
```

### List available projects

Run `gbck --list` to see a list of available projects even with information when where lastly updated.

### Back up a project

For back up all project just simply run `gbck`. If you want to back up particular project run e.g. `gbck dotfiles private-dotfiles`

If you run this command along with `--auto-commit` you won't be asked for a commit message. This could be good for some types of automatization.
